# Android-Note-Kotlin
Kotlin version of a note taking app by bereatac.
As of July 7th I take 0 credit for anything written here.
This is an example for me to learn how to use GIT/GIT HUB
as well as some Androidx libraries with Kotlin.

Originally done by Coding in FLow on YouTube, this Kotlinized 
version original can be found here
